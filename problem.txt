 
1. Coding from scratch (not sourcing online)
2. Documentation 
3. Unit Testing
 
 
The kata exercise for a given candidate is to write a simple application in the programming language of his choice (it can be something that runs at the command prompt) that will recognize a Roman number that has been entered and then convert it to standard numbers.   It will also recognize a regular number than has been entered and convert it to a Roman numeral.

Example 1:
         Input: XVII
         Ouput: 17
 
Example 2:
         Input: 9
         Output: IX
 
The application shouldnâ€™t handle any numbers larger than 3,000 and I should be able to put in a number over and over again (Roman or regular) until I decide to the quit the application.
 
The kata should be returned with complete source code, installation and run instructions along with what the candidate considers sufficient application documentation, unit testing, and error handling.
